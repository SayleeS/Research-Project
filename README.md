# Research-Project
One of the main challenges of head mounted immersive technologies is how to make interactions with the environment more friendly for the users. Hand tracking systems aim to turn the interactions between the users and the immersive systems more natural, since in real life this is the standard way of manipulating objects and interacting with the physical world. However, hand tracking is still limited , as it usually relies on good light conditions and gesture recognition to recognize the hands and perform the  actions. It also lacks the haptic feedback of touching a real surface, which can make it less comfortable to users and adds a layer of complexity to final users who are not used to augmented reality headsets and their interaction techniques. In this research project, we want to explore how smart device's screens can be used as a portable surface and how simple gestures performed on this surface can help users to control and interact with the immersive emvironment.
